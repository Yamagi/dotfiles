My Dotfiles
-----------
This is a small git repository, containing my essential dotfiles. Just
enough to get a basic system up and running, not all the fancy stuff
which differs from host to host anyways. It's supposed to be directly
checked out into ${HOME}. For a new install (into an empty ${HOME},
existing directory may need some special treatment) do:

1. Set an alias into yout tcsh:
 % alias dotfiles 'git --work-tree=${HOME} --git-dir=${HOME}/.dotfiles'

2. Clone:
 % dotfiles clone https://github.com/Yamagi/dotfiles.git

3. Tell git to exclude non tracked files:
 % dotfiles config status.showuntrackedfiles no

After a logout / login cycle you're done and the basic environment is
set up. Please note again, that only basic tools are covered and not big
things like Chrome or the like. For a X11 setup its recommended to
install some icons.

This dotfiles are build around my workflow. They may not fit yours! Do
not complain to me if you don't like my decisions, feel free to fork 
this repository. :) Nevertheless, if you have some cool ideas or even
found a bug, do not hesitate to tell me at yamagi [at] yamagi [dot] org.

Some of the older configuration files are still commented in german.
Maybe I'll translate them some day, but not now. Since I'm a FreeBSD guy
this setup is somewhat FreeBSD centric. It may work on Linux and even OS
X, but I cannot guarantee that. You can do with this files whatever you
want, but please note that they come WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY!
