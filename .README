My Dotfiles
-----------

This is a small git repository, containing my essential dotfiles. Just
enough to get a basic system up and running, not all the fancy stuff
which differs from host to host anyways. It's supposed to be directly
checked out into ${HOME}. For a new install (into an empty ${HOME},
existing directory may require some special treatment) do:

1. Set an alias into your shell:
 % alias dotfiles 'git --work-tree=${HOME} --git-dir=${HOME}/.dotfiles'

2. Clone:
 % dotfiles clone https://github.com/Yamagi/dotfiles.git

3. Move the git directory:
 % mv dotfiles/.git ~/.dotfiles

4. Checkout:
 % cd ~ ; dotfiles checkout .

3. Tell git to exclude non tracked files:
 % dotfiles config status.showuntrackedfiles no

After a logout / login cycle you're done and the basic environment is
set up. Please note again, that only basic tools are covered and not big
things like Chrome or the like. For a X11 setup its recommended to
unpack the icons found in ~/.icons.

This dotfiles are build around my workflow. They may not fit yours! Do
not complain to me if you don't like my decisions, feel free to fork 
this repository. :) Nevertheless, if you have some cool ideas or even
found a bug, do not hesitate to tell me at yamagi [at] yamagi [dot] org.

Some of the older configuration files are still commented in german.
Maybe I'll translate them some day, but not now. Since I'm a FreeBSD guy
this setup is somewhat FreeBSD centric. It may work on Linux and even OS
X, but I cannot guarantee that. You can do with this files whatever you
want, but please note that they come WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY!
