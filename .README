My Dotfiles
-----------

This is a small git repository, containing my essential dotfiles. Just
enough to get a basic system up and running, not all the fancy stuff
which differs from host to host anyways. It's supposed to be directly
checked out into $HOME. For a new install (into an empty $HOME, existing
directory may require some special treatment) do:

1. Set an alias into your shell:
 % alias dotfiles 'git --work-tree=${HOME} --git-dir=${HOME}/.dotfiles'

2. Clone:
 % dotfiles clone https://github.com/Yamagi/dotfiles.git

3. Move the git directory:
 % mv dotfiles/.git ~/.dotfiles

4. Checkout:
 % cd ~ ; dotfiles checkout .

3. Tell git to exclude non tracked files:
 % dotfiles config status.showuntrackedfiles no

After a logout / login cycle you're done and the basic environment is
set up. Please note again, that only basic tools are covered. Not the
big ones like Firefox or Plasma with it's convoluted configuration.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------- #

Some additional stuff like a list of all applications and Gnome dconf
dumps can be found in the .misc/ directory. Some machines have several
individual config files or changes to existing configuration files.
These can be found in branches under the machine/ namespace.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------- #

These dotfiles are build around my workflow. They may not fit yours! Do
not complain to me if you don't like my decisions, feel free to fork 
this repository. :)

Some of the older configuration files are still commented in german.
Maybe I'll translate them some day, but not now. Since I'm a FreeBSD
and Linux guy this configuration is focused on that systems. They may
or may not work on OS X or WSL. You can do with these files whatever you
want, but please note that they come WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY!
