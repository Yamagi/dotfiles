# mpv.conf for high quality playback. It requires an
# somewhat up to date GPU with full Vulkan support.
# For video resolutions over 1080p the GPU must be
# rather powerfull, e.g. most older iGPUs are too
# slow.
#
# Tips to speed things up:
#  * Don't apply the 'high-quality' profile. This
#    alone reduces the GPU load a lot, especially
#    for video resolutions above 1080p.
#  * If that isn't enough, apply the 'fast' profile.
#  * Use 'vo=gpu' and 'gpu-api=opengl' for older GPUs
#    without (any|full|good) Vulkan support. This is
#    incompatible with 'vd-lavc-film-grain=gpu', but
#    those old systems aren't fast enough for codecs
#    requiring grain synthesis anyways. At least not
#    with higher videos resolutions.
#  * Modern codecs like AV1 or VVC have a tendency
#    for spikes, e.g. a small amount of frames need
#    way more CPU power to decode than the average
#    frame. On slower CPUs this leads to stuttering.
#    The decoder misses the time window for theses
#    more complex frames and subsequent frames must
#    be dropped to keep the audio in sync. Using a
#    decoder queue to cache decoded frames can work
#    wonders, at the expense of increased memory
#    usage:
#      vd-queue-enable=yes
#      vd-queue-max-bytes=6GiB
#      vd-queue-max-samples=1048576
#      vd-queue-max-secs=30

# Caching:
#  * Read 30 seconds ahead, store...
#  * ...up to 256M future...
#  * ...and up to 128M past data.
# This isn't really necessary on fast machines, but
# helps on old hardware with slow storage and some
# non-realtime network stream. In any case caching
# doesn't hurt.

# Resample Files with 50 FPS to more reasonable 25 FPS.
# Files with 50 FPS are almost always PAL interlaced or
# PAL with broken deinterlacing applied and are still
# somewhat common in parts of europe. For example the
# "Mediatheken" of the german public broadcasters have
# a lot 50 FPS deinterlaced files, up to 1080p. Try
# to detect them and apply pulldown to more reasonable
# 25 FPS. That makes them look more natural and less
# "soapy". It also helps with 4k displays connected
# through HDMI 1.4. Since the container metadata may
# not be 100% correct, apply some skew to the detection.
